# 🌍 Trippy - Tour & Travel Website

A modern, fully responsive travel agency website built with **React** and **Vite**. 
This project was built to practice Component-Based Architecture, Client-Side Routing, and Responsive UI Design.

🔗 **Live Demo:**

## 🚀 Tech Stack
* **Framework:** React JS (Functional Components + Hooks)
* **Build Tool:** Vite (Fast HMR)
* **Routing:** React Router v6
* **Styling:** CSS3 (Mobile-First approach)
* **Icons:** FontAwesome

## ✨ Key Features
* **Dynamic Components:** Reused a single `Hero` component across multiple pages by passing data via Props.
* **Mobile Responsive:** Fully functional hamburger menu that toggles state for mobile devices.
* **Single Page Application (SPA):** Smooth page transitions without reloading using `react-router-dom`.
* **Data Mapping:** Navigation and Trip cards are generated dynamically by mapping over data arrays, making it easy to add new content.

## 🧠 What I Learned
Building this project helped me solidify several core React concepts:
1.  **State Management:** Used `useState` to handle UI logic like the mobile menu toggle.
2.  **Props & Reusability:** Learned how to pass data *down* to child components to keep code DRY.
3.  **Modern React Patterns:** Migrated older Class Component tutorials into modern **Functional Components** to stay up-to-date with industry standards.
